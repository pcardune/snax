# Finite Automata

## Nondeterministic Finite Automata

A nondeterministic finite automaton (or NFA) consists of the following:

1. a set of states (we'll assign each state a unique number), which contains
   - exactly one _start state_
   - one or more _accepting states_
   - any number of other states that are neither an accepting state nor the start state
2. a set of input symbols, referred to as the _input alphabet_
3. a _transition function_ that takes a state and symbol and returns a set of _next states_

An NFA can be represented visually as a graph:

<NFAGraph nfa={nfa} height={150} width={300} />

In this visualization, the set of states is {0,1,2,3}, with the start state 0
indicated by a diamond shaped node, and the accepting state 3 indicated by a double
bordered node. The labeled edges between nodes indicate the transition function.
Each edge is labeled with a symbol from the alphabet, which in this case is the
set \{f, o\}.

An NFA can also be represented with a table:

<NFATable nfa={nfa} />

In this table there is a row for each state, and a column for each symbol in the
alphabet. The start state is indicated by a > and accepting states are indicated
with a \*.

Here is a more complex example of an NFA with multiple accepting states,
edges that loop back to the state they started from, etc.

<NFAGraph nfa={regexNFA} layout="cose" width={400} height={250} />

and it's corresponding table:

<NFATable nfa={regexNFA} />
