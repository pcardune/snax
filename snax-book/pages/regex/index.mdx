# Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are a notation for describing the strings of letters
that make up all the words of a _language_.

## Languages

Abstractly, a language consists
of a potentially infinite set of words, where each word is a sequence
of characters in an alphabet.

For example, we might define a language, _L1_, as:

> L1 is the set of words including \{_"fee"_, _"fi"_, _"fo"_, _"fum"_\}

The alphabet for this language
would be the set of characters {e, f, i, m, o, u}.

We could define another language, _L2_, using this same alphabet:

> L2 is all words that start with _"f"_, followed by one or more of the
> letters in _{e, i, m, o, u}_.

This new language would contain all the words from L1,
along with the words _"feiomu"_, _"feeeeee"_,
_"foo"_, _"fooo"_, _"foooo"_, _"fooooo"_, ... and an infinite number
of other words. But it does not contain the word _"om"_ because _"om"_
does not start with _"f"_. Nor does it contain the word _"foobar"_ because
_"b"_ is not part of L2's alphabet.

Ultimately, we'd like to hand the computer a language of our own design
and then ask the computer if a particular string of text represents
a word in that language. We can do that with regular expressions...

## Regular Expression Syntax

For the computer to check if a word is in a given language,
it must be given that language in a way that it can understand.
Instead of telling the computer that our language is "the set of all
words that start with f, followed by one or more of the
letters: {e, i, m, o, u}," we give the computer the regular expression
**`f(e|i|m|o|u)(e|i|m|o|u)*`**, which is a more precise way of saying
the same thing.

Every regular expression is one of the following:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Syntax</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>empty string</td>
      <td align="center">
        <code>()</code>
      </td>
      <td>a language containing only the empty string ""</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>one character</td>
      <td align="center">
        <code>(a)</code>
      </td>
      <td>a language containing just the word "a"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>concatenation</td>
      <td align="center">
        <code style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>(r)(s)</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        words from language <code>(r)</code> joined with words from language{' '}
        <code>(s)</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>union</td>
      <td align="center">
        <code style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>(r)|(s)</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        words from language <code>(r)</code> and words from language{' '}
        <code>(s)</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>kleene closure</td>
      <td align="center">
        <code style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>(r)*</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        words from language <code>(r)</code>, concatenated 0 or more times
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The use of parentheses is optional when the order of operations is clear,
so

```
((fee)|(fi)|(fo)|(fum))
```

can be written

```
fee|fi|fo|fum
```

_Note: the regular expression syntax used by a lot of tools and programming language
can be a lot more complicated, but they are all just extensions of the above. For
example, `[abc]+` is just a shorthand for `(a|b|c)(a|b|c)*`._

While regular expressions provide a concise and formal way of defining languages,
they are not by themselves particularly helpful when it comes to answering the question
of whether or not a particular sequence of characters is part of that language.
For that we need other abstractions.

The rest of this chapter will talk about those other abstractions, how they relate
to regular expressions, and eventually how we can turn a regular expression into
a program that can answer our question very quickly.
