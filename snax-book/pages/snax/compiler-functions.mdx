# Compiler Functions

Compiler functions give you access to features that aren't
part of the snax language and depend on the compiler implementation.

Since the snax compiler compiles to web assembly, many of these
functions are just built in functions from web assembly. As such
they require special care to use.

## Type Information

### $size_of

The `$size_of` compiler function will give you the number of bytes
used by a value. This is computed at compile time.

```snax
// an array of i32. Each i32 is 4 bytes,
// so the total size of this array is 12 bytes
$size_of([1,2,3]);
```

You can also pass in the name of a type to get it's size:

```snax
struct Vector {
  x: f64;
  y: f64;
}
$size_of(Vector);
```

## Bulk Memory Operations

### $memory_copy

You can copy data from one place in memory to another place in memory
using the `$memory_copy` compiler function.

```snax
import io from "snax/io.snx"
import string from "snax/string.snx"

let a = [1, 2, 3];
let b = [4, 5, 6];
$memory_copy(@a, @b, $size_of(b));
io::printStr(@string::stri32(a[0]));
io::printStr(@string::stri32(a[1]));
io::printStr(@string::stri32(a[2]));
```
