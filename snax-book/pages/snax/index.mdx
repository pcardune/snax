# Snax

Snax is a simple, low-level programming language that compiles to web assembly.

<SnaxEditor>
{`
import io from "snax/io.snx"

io::printStr(@"Hello, world!");
`}
</SnaxEditor>

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to install the snax compiler:

```bash
npm install -g snax-lang
```

Then, create a file called `hello.snx` with the following contents:

```snx
import io from "snax/io.snx";

io::print(@"Hello, world!");
```

Finally, compile and run your program:

```bash
snax hello.snx
```
