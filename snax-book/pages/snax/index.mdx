# Language Overview

Snax is a simple, low-level programming language that compiles to web assembly.

## Hello World

Because you have to get hello world out of the way really quickly, here it is:

<SnaxEditor>
{`
import io from "snax/io.snx"

io::printStr(@"Hello, world!");
`}
</SnaxEditor>

## Data Types

### Numbers

Numbers come in two flavors, floating point and integers. Floating points come in 32 and 64 bit variants, while integers come in 8, 16, 32, and 64 bit variants. In addition, integers can be either signed or unsigned.

<SnaxEditor>
{`
import io from "snax/io.snx"
let a = 1.0;
io::print_u32(12);
`}
</SnaxEditor>

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to install the snax compiler:

```bash
npm install -g snax-lang
```

Then, create a file called `hello.snx` with the following contents:

```snx
import io from "snax/io.snx";

io::print(@"Hello, world!");
```

Finally, compile and run your program:

```bash
snax hello.snx
```
