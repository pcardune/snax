# Numbers in Snax

Numbers come in the usual two flavors:

Integers:

```snax
245;
```

Floats:

```snax
2.45;
```

By default, integers are signed 32 bit integers, and floats are 32 bit floats. However, you can specify the number of bits to use by appending a suffix. For
integers, you can also choose between signed and unsigned variants. Here are some
examples:

```snax
// signed and unsigned integer variants
12_i8;
12_u8;
1234_i16;
1234_u16;
1234_i32;
1234_u32;
1234_i64;
1234_u64;

// signed float variants
1234.5678_f32;
1234.5678_f64;
```

If the suffix is not specified, it will be inferred from the context.
In the below example, the number `56` will be treated as an unsigned 8 bit
integer since it is being added to one.

```snax
60_u8 + 56;
```

As a result, if you try to add a number that is too large to fit into the
number being added to, you'll get a type error:

```snax
60_u8 + 566;
```

But the other way around will work just fine as the left hand side of the expression defaults to a 32 bit signed integer:

```snax
566 + 60_u8;
```

Overflows will wrap around, so be careful. In this example, adding 1 to an unsigned 8-bit integer works fine:

```snax
let x:u8 = 127_u8 + 1;
x;
```

But if the integer is signed, then it overflows, wrapping around to -128:

```snax
let x:i8 = 127_i8 + 1;
x;
```

**Warning:** Overflows are not checked at runtime, and may lead to undefined behavior! Consider these two examples which produce different results:

This example will overflow, and wrap around:

```snax
let x:u8 = 255_u8 + 120;
x;
```

Whereas this example will magically turn into a 32 bit integer because
the values are only stored in webassembly's native stack where all integers
are 32 bits:

```snax
255_u8 + 120;
```
