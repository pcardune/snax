# Strings in Snax

Strings in snax are represented as a struct containing a pointer to the string data, which is stored in a u8 array, and the length of the string.

```snax
import io from "snax/io.snx"

let s = "Hello World";
io::printStr(@s);
io::printStr(@" has length ");
io::print_u32(s.length);
```

You can construct a string more explicitly with the struct itself:

```snax
import io from "snax/io.snx"
import string from "snax/string.snx"

let buffer = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
let s = string::String::{
    buffer: @buffer,
    length: 3
};
io::printStr(@s);
```
