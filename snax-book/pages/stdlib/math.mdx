# The snax/math.snx module

Since snax doesn't currently support generics, all math functions
come in a number of variants for the different numerical types.
For example, to calculate the `sin(x)`, you must choose between
the 32 and 64 bit float variants: `sinf32(x)` and `sinf64(x)`,
depending on the type of `x`.

## Floating Point Functions

```snax
import math from "snax/math.snx"
math::sqrtf32(4.0);
```

## Trigonometric Functions

Snax currently supports `sin` and `cos` functions for 32 and 64 bit floats.

```snax
import math from "snax/math.snx"
math::cosf32(2.0);
math::cosf64(2.0);
```

```snax
import math from "snax/math.snx"
math::sinf32(2.0);
math::sinf64(2.0_f64);
```

These functions are implemented using [Bhaskara I's approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaskara_I%27s_sine_approximation_formula) and will differ slightly from the output of trigonometric functions from other languages.
